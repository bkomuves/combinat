combinat - a Haskell combinatorics library
------------------------------------------

This is a combinatorics library for Haskell. It contains functions 
enumerating, counting, visualizing, manipulating, and sometimes randomly sampling 
from many standard combinatorial objects, including:

* subsets
* compositions
* trees
* numbers:
    * natural numbers
    * prime numbers
    * formal power series
* permutations
* partitions:
    * integer partitions
    * set partitions, multiset partitions, non-crossing partitions
    * plane partitions
    * vector partitions
    * skew partitions, ribbons
* Young tableaux, Littlewood-Richardson coefficients
* lattice paths, Dyck paths
* groups:
    * permutation groups
    * braid groups
    * free groups, free products of cyclic groups
    * Thompson's group F
